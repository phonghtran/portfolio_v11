					Joining Obviously as a Lead Designer marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey in a
					rapidly evolving digital landscape. At the time, this influencer and social media agency,
					later acquired by VMLY&R of WPP in 2022, was a remote-only startup. The company stood at a
					pivotal point, with no established design team or consistent design practices in place.
					Embracing this challenge, I embarked on a transformative mission to reshape the
					organization's approach to product and engineering processes.
				</p>
				<p>
					My primary goal was to pivot these processes to be research and design-led, a strategy
					that would permeate through every stage from discovery to the launch of nearly every
					feature. This shift required not just a change in processes but a cultural shift within
					the organization. By initiating workshops and leveraging virtual collaboration tools, I
					guided diverse teams - from operations to marketing, and up to the executive level - on
					roadmap building and general decision-making across the organization. This inclusive
					approach ensured a cohesive and unified direction in all our endeavors.
				</p>
				<p>
					A significant achievement during my tenure was the implementation of a JIRA-based visual
					QA system. This system streamlined our collaboration with the Engineering team, ensuring
					that all designs were meticulously verified and aligned with our high standards. The
					impact of this system was immediate and profound, enhancing efficiency and reducing
					turnaround times for design approvals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Understanding the vital role of internal marketing in a company's growth, I established a
					request-based workflow specifically for all internal marketing design requests. This
					workflow was tailored to meet the dynamic needs of my team, ensuring a systematic and
					organized approach to handling these essential tasks. This initiative not only optimized
					our internal processes but also significantly improved the quality and consistency of our
					marketing materials.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, my journey at Obviously was marked by a series of strategic implementations
					and leadership initiatives that profoundly transformed the organization's design and
					operational landscape. From establishing foundational design practices to enhancing
					cross-functional collaboration, my role as a Lead Designer was instrumental in steering
					the company towards a design-centric future. The legacy of these changes continues to
					resonate within the organization, underscoring the lasting impact of thoughtfully executed
					design leadership.

					Embarking on a dynamic journey with Designit, a prestigious global design consultancy, I
					found myself at the crossroads of innovation and creativity. Esteemed for its association
					with a roster of Fortune 500 companies, Designit presented a vibrant landscape where my
					skills in facilitating Design Thinking processes and workshops were put to the test. My
					role was pivotal in navigating the complex interplay of design and technology, a crucial

					Bank, and GSK.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this arena, the challenges were diverse and invigorating. A notable aspect of my
					contributions involved aiding these industry giants in their quest to evolve and adapt to
					modern realities. This often meant devising strategies for transitioning legacy systems,

					technological shift but also in providing insightful perspectives on retraining and
					development, ensuring a smooth transition for all stakeholders involved.
				</p>
				<p>
					The scope of my work spanned a broad spectrum, where I was tasked with delivering a

					and detailed user personas. Each project was a unique blend of art and science, requiring
					a deep understanding of both the aesthetic and functional aspects of design.
				</p>
				<p>
					My tenure at Designit was more than just a job; it was a journey of professional growth
					and creative exploration. It was an opportunity to leave a mark on some of the most

					At Cornerstone OnDemand, a leader in cloud-based SaaS HR enterprise software, I embarked
					on an illustrious journey, navigating the multifaceted realms of payroll, learning modules
					(LMS), performance management, and recruiting. As the custodian of the Learning Management
					System (LMS), I was at the helm of steering the research, UI, and UX efforts, spearheading
					initiatives that would redefine the user experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					My responsibilities, initially confined to the LMS, gradually expanded to encompass other
					significant product lines, including Reporting and Performance. This expansion was not
					just a testament to my evolving role but also to the trust and confidence placed in my
					capabilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					A pivotal cultural shift occurred during my tenure, where the focus of research and
					ideation transitioned from the Product team to the Design team. This strategic move
					underscored the increasing importance of design in the product development process. I
					played a central role in facilitating this shift, advocating for research protocols and
					activities that emphasized user-centricity over mere business considerations.
				</p>
				<p>
					This paradigm shift towards a more design-focused approach was not just a change in
					process but a revolution in perspective. It marked the dawn of an era where design was no
					longer an afterthought but a driving force in product development, ensuring that user
					needs and experiences were at the forefront of every decision.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summary, my journey at Cornerstone OnDemand was marked by significant contributions
					that went beyond traditional design roles. It was an expedition that saw the
					transformation of product lines and the redefinition of organizational culture, with
					design and user-centricity taking center stage in the narrative of innovation and
					enterprise solutions.
