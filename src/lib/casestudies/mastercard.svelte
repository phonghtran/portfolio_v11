		<h3>Context</h3>
		<p>
			It’s one of those projects where it’s less about the UX and designs, but more about the
			approach and meeting the client where they are. The client team had a vision for a streamlined
			internal process of data ingest and visualization. However, the existing team was having
			trouble translating the requirements and desires into designs that matched the clients’ wants.

		<h3>Dropping In</h3>
		<p>
			With the client super frustrated, it was thought I could try leading the project and bring in
			a fresh perspective. Instead of redoing all the workshop activities and re-interviewing all
			the stakeholders again, I decided to dive right in. On our virtual calls, I opened up Figma
			and just let them describe how they saw the project and its features. While they talked I
			attempted to sketch out the systems and flows they were discussing. It helped that I had a
			technical background and could understand database systems and ETL flows.
		</p>

		<p>
			In each discussion, we had sketches and workflows that they felt happy with. More importantly,
			I learned their trust to keep the talks going. As I gained more confidence that I was
			interpreting their vision correctly, I would work with our designers to work out screens to
			flesh out. Those would be shown to the client, get approved, and we would then move to the
			next set of screens to sketch out live. Each day would be a bit different as I would drive
			them toward the priority of the day, whether it was wireframes, user stories, or screens to
			react to.
		</p>

		<p>
			Figma prototypes doubled as slide presentations as we were already in those files so intensely
			every day. We could link dynamically each workflow as it matured and was worked on.
