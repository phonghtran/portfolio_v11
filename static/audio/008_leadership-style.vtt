First and foremost set the tone that I'm
always happy to collaborate and assist.

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.679
But ultimately let my people tackle
the problems in their own unique way.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.629
Everyone has their
strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.723
So I'd like for them to bring their
strengths to solving without being

00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:14.403
bogged down or watched like a hawk.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:18.363
The counter balance has to be mindful
of the timeline and scope, but that can

00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:22.323
be negotiated both directions: downwards
to the team and upwards to leadership.

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:25.026
With my experience in consulting,
I'm pretty good at quickly

00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:28.326
diagnosing issues and realizing the
direction my team is attempting.

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:32.916
So I can jump in periodically to uncover
holes as they shape and hone their ideas.

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:37.086
Intellectually, I find myself more
interested in overall system and process

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:39.246
than plucking granular, tiny weeds.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:43.686
So I tend to be a good leader to
reach out for exploratory big ideas.
