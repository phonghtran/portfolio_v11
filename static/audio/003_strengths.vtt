I'm most proud of my
most intangible skill,

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.181
and it's the bridging
different teams together.

00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:07.963
I tend to understand complex
systems pretty quickly.

00:00:08.013 --> 00:00:11.760
And can articulate the main issues to
any number of different stakeholders.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.630
So maybe pointing out process
inefficiencies with business users

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.980
or problem spaces to the product people,
or technology needs to engineers.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
I can usually build a theoretical
framework that overlaps the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.420
goals of very different people or
facilitate workshops if it turns out

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.040
those goals don't overlap at all.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.350
From a design tool set:

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.450
Another strength is my versatility.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.430
I'm comfortable working in all

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.090
phases of the product life cycle, so I
can help young PMs with their discovery,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.590
I can conduct research.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.990
I can sketch and build UI, and I can
code or help the engineers directly.
