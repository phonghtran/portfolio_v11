00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.660
And maybe my experiences often to
hurdles, aren't the ideas, but the

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.370
people involved in the process.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.800
And I don't even mean
assholes are tyrants.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.110
Often it's well-meaning people,
but they may be less successful

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.250
in communicating or anxious about
hitting their personal goals.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.640
A good example is also
that recent AI project.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.280
Our two main stakeholders were
surprisingly aligned on both

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.670
goal and approach, but the
communication was lacking.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.150
One spoken technology with other
ones spoken business problems.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.720
So the business guy, but the tech
guy was being short-sighted by only

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.700
talking about granular tech solutions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.660
Not realizing that some of the pieces
were foundational to even his solutions

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.560
or that things need to be coded in
a particular order to unlock things.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:41.062
Even worse.

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:43.492
Both of them were far too busy
being leaders of the company

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:45.142
to even meet up to talk.

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:51.352
So as a result, the PMN and I acted as an
intermediary to document their needs in

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:53.602
a face sets of user stories and features.

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:56.809
The phases showed the business
guy Would eventually get his

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.519
MVP within a given timeframe.

00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:01.789
While the feature documentation helped
the tech guy stay focused and the

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.349
shortest specs were accounted for.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.525
We say pretty agile and pretty, fluid
as we met with people and kept them

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.805
updating either together or separately.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.920
But that eventually got over
the hump and got, code shipped.
