00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.490
We're not going into too
much granular detail.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.800
My processes are modeled
after design thinking.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.950
And the converging diverging
flow of activities.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.000
Early on.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.370
I like to ensure all the stakeholders
give their thoughts and the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.200
problem solve and their end goals.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.970
In a workshop format, we can quickly to
get alignment and build early hypothesis.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.139
The next discovery phase.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.059
Exploring these problem spaces.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.859
Casting a wide net.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.606
This can be doing traditional interviews.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:27.346
Would users are looking at
our current state of the

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:29.056
technology that's implemented.

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:33.766
We will converge these findings into two
or three themes or possible approaches.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.566
Moving into the meat of the design.

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:38.236
We can start doing sketches,
screens prototypes.

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:38.817
Collaborate with.

00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:42.297
PMs and engineers to maintain
feasibility and coherency.

00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:44.607
Stakeholders are course
updated, has needed.

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:49.021
We then move into specs and high
fidelity into the engineering phase.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.901
I like to do a lot of QA
testing here, actually.

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.291
, so to make sure the design vision
is realized within the code.

00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:59.261
Then as we approached lunch, the change
management and documentation is happening

00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:04.391
with product ops and marketing teams for
launching a new features with our users.
