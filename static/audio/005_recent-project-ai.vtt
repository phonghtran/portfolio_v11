00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.220
My most recent company
was a social media agency.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.300
They had their custom technology stack to
manage advertising campaigns with social

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.340
media influencers, creating content.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.770
About a client's products or services.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.590
The other main value proposition is
that every client gets a dedicated.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.215
Client success team to do everything
on their behalf and they get bespoke

00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:22.985
reporting after the campaign wraps up.

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.045
Of course it should be apparent
that this type of service can

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:27.055
be really expensive to operate.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.205
So recently the leadership team
was asking the hot question.

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:32.058
Can AI make any of those cheaper?

00:00:32.218 --> 00:00:35.848
The short answer after much discovery
and research is no, not really.

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:36.808
No.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:40.917
AI platform or vendor has of today
can really replace the unique creative

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:45.087
requirements and outputs of any given
marketing campaign that we launch.

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:47.523
With in our system at any
given moment, we may have.

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:51.259
10 videos about a bottled water
launch or 200 about new lifts that

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.485
color or 5,000 travel tip videos.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:59.949
Each video needs to be assessed to its own
creative brief in both content and tone.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.389
However, instead of the problem being
about replacing everything with AI, the

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:08.649
team, and I produce a multi-phase plan
to increase the efficiency and ultimately

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.179
the operating margins of the company.

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:13.805
It would let her up to what AI
would do well by first implementing

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:15.365
his technological cousins.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:19.985
The first phase was using old school
logarithms to automate the workflows.

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.475
We had several third party
platforms in place to track and

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:24.035
document what the teens were doing.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.245
We realized by adding our few
simple calculations to our custom

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.405
platform, we could sunset all of them.

00:01:30.095 --> 00:01:33.665
Because ultimately every action
needs to occur within our software.

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:38.255
So we can add logarithms to track
the assets against the deadlines.

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:39.635
And who did the tasks?

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:42.545
This new data could then fly
the health of a campaign.

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:45.935
What goals are left unfinished and
even do automated time tracking

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:47.465
on behalf of everyone involved.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:50.915
The second phase after the
logarithms was machine learning ML.

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:53.255
We have two main buckets of data.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:57.335
One 10 years worth of working
with social media influencers

00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:58.895
and their performance data.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.145
Of that content they
posted to their accounts.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:05.615
This we could crunch until unique tagging
system that could predict and suggest the

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:07.955
best influencers for future campaigns.

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:12.185
Also after phase one
is working for a while.

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:15.035
We're going to take all of that
internal team's performance, the

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:18.125
scope out and price out feature
campaigns with our clients.

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:22.295
Because we would know how everything
actually took in terms of time and effort.

00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:23.345
The third phase.

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:27.725
Would be to eventually implement
AI in very specific use cases.

00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:30.695
This makes for easy to sprint
planning with the engineering team

00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:34.205
has we can insert them into the
backlog has separate features.

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:38.494
We realize  new theory of not
letting AI do everything, but we're

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:40.144
gonna let the, I do the first pass.

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:44.674
So the metaphor is like having an
intern attempt to do a task and then you

00:02:44.674 --> 00:02:46.204
would go in and double-check the work.

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.204
So we would love the AI
to do simple checking.

00:02:49.384 --> 00:02:53.584
Like if the influencer used the
right hashtags in their posts or.

00:02:53.684 --> 00:02:58.244
Or assess if the posted video they posted
tutor accounts was actually the video

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.644
that we approved for them weeks before.

00:03:00.644 --> 00:03:04.364
It would run the script and then
notify human to check as assessment.

00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:08.624
So ultimately these three phases
together would lead to the

00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:10.244
biggest cost savings and that.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.840
In some ways what's outside
the UX and software.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.100
But it was only possible because
of the UX and technology.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.490
Since the system was  aware
of task delegation and time

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.300
scoping and continuously taking
over more and more tasks.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.700
The human side simplifies.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.860
To a point where you can just transition
to lower cost job roles to supervise

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.380
and to manage a client what dynamically.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.397
So substituting in
