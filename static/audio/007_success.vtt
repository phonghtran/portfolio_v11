And the most concrete level is where the
business objectives were met and served.

00:00:04.453 --> 00:00:08.536
So that may be more task efficiency by
employees or more accuracy in the final

00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:12.706
product and features or more commonly,
if it lowered costs and raised profits.

00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:16.486
Now has a design practitioner
in the organization.

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.596
Additionally success for me is
whether the trade-offs are made

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:22.366
at the right place in the system.

00:00:23.026 --> 00:00:25.636
So let's say a piece of data
needs to be in the database for

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:26.926
something important to happened.

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:30.796
Something like a client's projects,
requirements need to be entered in.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:34.722
The design questions are then one
who would in the process is assigned

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.472
a data entry and then to can that
person fulfill that data entry as

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.662
efficiently and as accurate as possible.

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:44.024
Now if I can find myself answering
the first question, very Confidently

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:45.415
and then track the improvements.

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:48.085
That second question with
analytics or follow-up testing.

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:51.089
Then I consider that successful
from a design point of view.
