[00:00:00] 

[00:00:00] I'm a 16 year veteran UX and product designer. I have a diverse set of experiences, but my specialties are in SAS based enterprise level software. For the last 10 years or so I've been working in that space either directly or has a consultant. I have a wider [00:00:15] skill set being able to code in several languages, but also getting an art degree back in day. Doing print and graphic design on the side early on., I've also worked at small agencies to large international corporations. 

[00:00:26] So I'm quite comfortable and meeting rooms, talking to many different teams. [00:00:30] Also, I'm quite adept at running workshops for any topic from design itself to business problems, to organizational issues.

[00:00:37] We're not going into too much granular detail. My processes are modeled after design thinking. And the converging diverging flow of [00:00:45] activities. Early on. I like to ensure all the stakeholders give their thoughts and the problem solve and their end goals. In a workshop format, we can quickly to get alignment and build early hypothesis. The next discovery phase. Exploring these problem spaces. Casting a wide [00:01:00] net. This can be doing traditional interviews. 

[00:01:02] Would users are looking at our current state of the technology that's implemented. We will converge these findings into two or three themes or possible approaches. Moving into the meat of the design. We can start doing sketches, screens [00:01:15] prototypes. Collaborate with. PMs and engineers to maintain feasibility and coherency. Stakeholders are course updated, has needed. 

[00:01:22] We then move into specs and high fidelity into the engineering phase. I like to do a lot of QA testing here, actually. , so to make [00:01:30] sure the design vision is realized within the code. Then as we approached lunch, the change management and documentation is happening with product ops and marketing teams for launching a new features with our users. 

[00:01:41] I'm most proud of my most intangible skill. And [00:01:45] it's the bridging different teams together. I tend to understand complex systems pretty quickly. And can articulate the main issues to any number of different stakeholders. So maybe pointing out process inefficiencies with business users are problem spaces, the product people or [00:02:00] technology needs to engineers. I can usually build a theoretical framework that overlaps the goals of very different people or facilitate workshops if it turns out those goals don't overlap at all. From a design tool set. Another strength is my [00:02:15] versatility. I'm comfortable working in all. phases of the product life cycle, so I can help young PMs with their discovery. I can conduct research. I can sketch and build UI I can code or help the engineers directly. 

[00:02:27] I would say my main weakness is the flip [00:02:30] side of my strength. Being sole versatile and Jack of all trades. Not many of my skills go as deep as my fellow designers will go. So I might not have the juiciest visual work or dig the deepest into deepest insights from research. [00:02:45] 

[00:02:44] My most recent company was a social media agency. They had their custom technology stack to manage advertising campaigns with social media influencers, creating content. About a client's products or services. The other main value proposition [00:03:00] is that every client gets a dedicated. Client success team to do everything on their behalf and they get bespoke reporting after the campaign wraps up.

[00:03:07] Of course it should be apparent that this type of service can be really expensive to operate. So recently the leadership team was asking the hot [00:03:15] question. Can AI make any of those cheaper?

[00:03:16] The short answer after much discovery and research is no, not really. No. AI platform or vendor has of today can really replace the unique creative requirements and outputs of any given marketing campaign that we launch. [00:03:30] With in our system at any given moment, we may have. 10 videos about a bottled water launch or 200 about new lifts that color or 5,000 travel tip videos. Each video needs to be assessed to its own creative brief in both content and tone. 

[00:03:44] [00:03:45] However, instead of the problem being about replacing everything with AI, the team, and I produce a multi-phase plan to increase the efficiency and ultimately the operating margins of the company. It would let her up to what AI would do well by first implementing his technological [00:04:00] cousins. 

[00:04:00] The first phase was using old school logarithms to automate the workflows. We had several third party platforms in place to track and document what the teens were doing. We realized by adding our few simple calculations to our custom platform, we could sunset all of them. [00:04:15] Because ultimately every action needs to occur within our software. So we can add logarithms to track the assets against the deadlines. 

[00:04:23] And who did the tasks? This new data could then fly the health of a campaign. What goals are left unfinished and even do automated [00:04:30] time tracking on behalf of everyone involved. The second phase after the logarithms was machine learning ML. We have two main buckets of data. One 10 years worth of working with social media influencers and their performance data. Of that content they [00:04:45] posted to their accounts. This we could crunch until unique tagging system that could predict and suggest the best influencers for future campaigns. Also after phase one is working for a while. 

[00:04:57] We're going to take all of that internal team's performance, the [00:05:00] scope out and price out feature campaigns with our clients. Because we would know how everything actually took in terms of time and effort.

[00:05:07] The third phase. Would be to eventually implement AI in very specific use cases. This makes for easy to sprint planning with the [00:05:15] engineering team has we can insert them into the backlog has separate features. We realize new theory of not letting AI do everything, but we're gonna let the, I do the first pass. So the metaphor is like having an intern attempt to do a task and then you would go in [00:05:30] and double-check the work. So we would love the AI to do simple checking. 

[00:05:34] Like if the influencer used the right hashtags in their posts or. Or assess if the posted video they posted tutor accounts was actually the video that we approved for them weeks [00:05:45] before. It would run the script and then notify human to check as assessment. 

[00:05:49] So ultimately these three phases together would lead to the biggest cost savings and that. In some ways what's outside the UX and software. But it was only [00:06:00] possible because of the UX and technology. Since the system was aware of task delegation and time scoping and continuously taking over more and more tasks. 

[00:06:09] The human side simplifies. To a point where you can just transition to lower cost [00:06:15] job roles to supervise and to manage a client what dynamically. So substituting in cheaper contractors or even more AI bots themselves.

[00:06:24] And maybe my experiences often to hurdles, aren't the ideas, but the people involved in the process. [00:06:30] And I don't even mean assholes are tyrants. Often it's well-meaning people, but they may be less successful in communicating or anxious about hitting their personal goals. A good example is also that recent AI project. 

[00:06:42] Our two main stakeholders were surprisingly aligned on both [00:06:45] goal and approach, but the communication was lacking. One spoken technology with other ones spoken business problems. So the business guy, but the tech guy was being short-sighted by only talking about granular tech solutions. Not realizing that some of the pieces were foundational to [00:07:00] even his solutions or that things need to be coded in a particular order to unlock things. Even worse. 

[00:07:05] Both of them were far too busy being leaders of the company to even meet up to talk. So as a result, the PMN and I acted as an intermediary to [00:07:15] document their needs in a face sets of user stories and features. The phases showed the business guy Would eventually get his MVP within a given timeframe. While the feature documentation helped the tech guy stay focused and the shortest specs were accounted for. We say pretty agile and pretty, [00:07:30] fluid as we met with people and kept them updating either together or separately. But that eventually got over the hump and got, code shipped.

[00:07:38] 

[00:07:38] And the most concrete level is where the business objectives were met and served. So that may be more task efficiency [00:07:45] by employees or more accuracy in the final product and features or more commonly, if it lowered costs and raised profits. Now has a design practitioner in the organization. Additionally success for me is whether the trade-offs are made at the right place [00:08:00] in the system. So let's say a piece of data needs to be in the database for something important to happened. Something like a client's projects, requirements need to be entered in. The design questions are then one who would in the process is assigned a data entry and then to [00:08:15] can that person fulfill that data entry as efficiently and as accurate as possible. Now if I can find myself answering the first question, very Confidently and then track the improvements. 

[00:08:23] That second question with analytics or follow-up testing. Then I consider that successful from a design point of view.[00:08:30] 

[00:08:30] First and foremost set the tone that I'm always happy to collaborate and assist. But ultimately let my people tackle the problems in their own unique way. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. So I'd like for them to bring their strengths to solving without being bogged down or watched like a hawk. [00:08:45] The counter balance has to be mindful of the timeline and scope, but that can be negotiated both directions: downwards to the team and upwards to leadership. 

[00:08:52] With my experience in consulting, I'm pretty good at quickly diagnosing issues and realizing the direction my team is attempting. So I can jump in [00:09:00] periodically to uncover holes as they shape and hone their ideas. 

[00:09:03] Intellectually, I find myself more interested in overall system and process than plucking granular, tiny weeds. So I tend to be a good leader to reach out for exploratory big ideas.
