I'm a 16 year veteran
UX and product designer.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.270
I have a diverse set of experiences,
but my specialties are in SASS-

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.160
based enterprise level software.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.880
For the last 10 years or so I've
been working in that space either

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.590
directly or has a consultant.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.710
I have a wider skill set being able
to code in several languages, but also

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.150
getting an art degree back in day.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.729
Doing print and graphic design
on the side early on. I've

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:25.299
also worked at small agencies to
large international corporations.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.599
So I'm quite comfortable and meeting
rooms, talking to many different teams.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:32.289
Also, I'm quite adept at running
workshops for any topic from

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.679
design itself to business
problems, to organizational issues.
